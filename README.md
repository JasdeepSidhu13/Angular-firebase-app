# Angular-firebase-app
A simple website that uses Angular on the front end and firebase at the backend.

In order to build the project, you will need both Node.js and the Node Package Manager (which can be installed alongside Node.js).

You will also need the Angular CLI which can be installed through npm by running the following command:

npm install -g @angular/cli
Using -g will install the command line interface globally, allowing you to use the ng command, which is required to run the development server, as well as build the project.

After you have installed npm, run npm install in order to install the remaining dependencies.

Running The Project
In order to run the application, use npm start and navigate to http://localhost:3000/

Using The Angular CLI
Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Note that this will not start the backend, so unless you are only working with the frontend, you should instead use npm start and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.

Code scaffolding
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module.

Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.
